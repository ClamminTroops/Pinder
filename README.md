Hi it's Andre

Vision Statement:
    Dogs are wonderful human companions, a man’s best friend, but choosing the right dog is not always easy. For some American adults, it’s the paralysis of endless breed options, for others, the limit on their time to conduct research, and for others still, the overwhelming thought of where to begin. Wherever you find yourself in your dog search, the android pet-finding app Pinder is just for you. After launching the app, Pinder guides the user through a survey, designed to match one’s personality, preferences, and lifestyle to compatible dog breeds. Pinder displays the results in a ranked list, containing detailed information, photos, and videos for each breed. 
    The user can browse the results, favorite multiple breeds, and save the page to their account to refer to later. Once the user has decided on which dog they want to adopt, they can search the app’s database to find nearby shelters or owners in the United States with that dog. Pinder also includes a feature that allows dog owners to put up their dog for adoption on the app. Unlike apps such as Petfinder and coMpanion, which only serve to find dogs in shelters and do not recommend dog breeds to a specific person, Pinder offers both services and more in one app, designed not only to help you find your furry buddy, but also to help your furry buddy find a new home.
